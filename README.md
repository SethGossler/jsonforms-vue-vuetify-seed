# JSON Forms Vue 3 Example for OES w/ Vuetify

## Please Note...
This is NOT The original JSON Forms See App. That can be found here: https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-vue-seed.

I have no plans currently to maintain this repo. As of Early 2025, it may help you get started with Vue3 + Vuetify + JSON Forms.

## Instructions

This seed demonstrates how to use [JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io) with Vue in order to render a simple form for displaying a task entity.

It is based on the `vue create` Hello World project.

`src/App.vue` contains the JSON Forms specific code.

- Execute `pnpm dev` to start the application.

Browse to http://localhost:5173 to see the dev application in action.

For more information please see the JSON Forms Vue [documentation](https://jsonforms.io/docs/integrations/vue).
